You can insert these definitions in other pages using the `glossary-term` shortcode, so they must be self-contained.

Do this:

    A _foo_ is big bar.
    
Not this:

    A big bar.
    
Italicize the term whenever you use it in the definition.

An exception to this rule occurs when a term is an alias for another. In such cases, it is sufficient to use the phrase 'See [page kind]'."
