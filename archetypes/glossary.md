<!--
Glossary terms are maintained on dedicated individual pages within the documentation. These pages act as a central repository for all term definitions, although they are not directly visible to site visitors.

Definitions must be presented in complete sentences, with the first sentence always explicitly introducing the term being defined. The first occurrence of the term itself, along with any other referenced glossary terms, should be presented in italics within the definition. However, when a term is an alias for another term, the definition can simply state "See [page kind]" (e.g., "See [page kind]"). These guidelines aim to enhance the readability and consistency of all glossary definitions.

The "reference" field in the front matter of each definition page should be used to include a "See details" link at the end of the definition. This allows for flexible placement of the definition within the documentation while maintaining a central source for the definition itself. The value in the "reference" field must correspond to the logical path of the relevant page within the documentation structure.
