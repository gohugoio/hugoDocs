Note that the filename must be relative to the current project working directory.

So, if you have a file with the name `README.txt` in the root of your project with the content `Hugo Rocks!`:

```html
{{readFile "README.txt"}} â†’ "Hugo Rocks!"
```

For more information on using `readDir` and `readFile` in your templates, see [Local File Templates][local].
