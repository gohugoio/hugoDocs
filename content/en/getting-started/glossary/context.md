title: context
---

Represented by a dot "." within a [template action], context is the current location in a data structure. For example, while iterating over a [collection] of pages, the context within each iteration is the page's data structure. The context received by each template depends on template type and/or how it was called. See&nbsp;[details](/templates/introduction/#context).
