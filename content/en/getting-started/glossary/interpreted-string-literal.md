title: interpreted string literal
---

Interpreted string literals are character sequences between double quotes, as in "foo". Within the quotes, any character may appear except a newline and an unescaped double quote. The text between the quotes forms the value of the literal, with backslash escapes interpreted. See [details](https://go.dev/ref/spec#String_literals).
