title: string literal (raw)
---

Raw string literals are character sequences between backticks, as in \`bar\`. Within the backticks, any character may appear except a backtick. Backslashes have no special meaning and the string may contain newlines. Carriage return characters (`\r`) inside raw string literals are discarded from the raw string value. See [details](https://go.dev/ref/spec#String_literals).
