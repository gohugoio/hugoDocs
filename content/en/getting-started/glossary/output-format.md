title: output format
---

Hugo generates one or more files per page when building a site. For example, when rendering home, [section](g), [taxonomy](g), and [term](g) pages, Hugo generates an HTML file and an RSS file. Both HTML and RSS are built-in _output formats_. Create multiple output formats, and control generation based on [page kind](g), or by enabling one or more output formats for one or more pages. See&nbsp;[details].
