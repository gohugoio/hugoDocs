title: branch bundle
---

A directory that contains an `_index.md` file and zero or more [resources][resource]. Analogous to a physical branch, a branch bundle may have descendants including leaf bundles and other branch bundles. Top level directories with or without `_index.md` files are also branch bundles. This includes the home page. See&nbsp;[details](/content-management/page-bundles/).
