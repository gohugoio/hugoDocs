title: weight
---

Used to position an element within a collection sorted by weight. Assign weights using non-zero integers. Lighter items float to the top, while heavier items sink to the bottom. Unweighted or zero-weighted elements are placed at the end of the collection. Weights are typically assigned to pages, menu entries, languages, and output formats.
