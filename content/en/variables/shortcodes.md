[Shortcodes][shortcodes] have access to parameters delimited in the shortcode declaration via [`.Get`][getfunction], page- and site-level variables, and also the following shortcode-specific fields:

.Name
: Shortcode name.

.Ordinal
: Zero-based ordinal in relation to its parent. If the parent is the page itself, this ordinal will represent the position of this shortcode in the page content.

.Page
: The owning Â´Page`.

.Parent
: provides access to the parent shortcode context in nested shortcodes. This can be very useful for inheritance of common shortcode parameters from the root.

.Position
: Contains [file name and position](https://godoc.org/github.com/gohugoio/hugo/common/text#Position) for the shortcode in a page. Note that this can be relatively expensive to calculate, and is meant for error reporting. See [Error Handling in Shortcodes](/templates/shortcode-templates/#error-handling-in-shortcodes).

.IsNamedParams
: boolean that returns `true` when the shortcode in question uses [named rather than positional parameters][shortcodes]

.Inner
: represents the content between the opening and closing shortcode tags when a [closing shortcode][markdownshortcode] is used

.Scratch
: returns a writable [`Scratch`][scratch] to store and manipulate data which will be attached to the shortcode context. This scratch is reset on server rebuilds.

.InnerDeindent {{< new-in "0.100.0" >}}
: Gets the `.Inner` with any indentation removed. This is what's used in the built-in `{{</* highlight */>}}` shortcode.
