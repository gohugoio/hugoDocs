Format a `time.Time` value based on [Go's reference time]:

[Go's reference time]: https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants

```text {copy=false}
Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006
```

Create a format string using these components:

Description|Valid components
:--|:--
Year|`"2006" "06"`
Month|`"Jan" "January" "01" "1"`
Day of the week|`"Mon" "Monday"`
Day of the month|`"2" "_2" "02"`
Day of the year|`"__2" "002"`
Hour|`"15" "3" "03"`
Minute|`"4" "04"`
Second|`"5" "05"`
AM/PM mark|`"PM"`
Time zone offsets|`"-0700" "-07:00" "-07" "-070000" "-07:00:00"`

Replace the sign in the format string with a Z to print Z instead of an offset for the UTC zone.

Description|Valid components
:--|:--
Time zone offsets|`"Z0700" "Z07:00" "Z07" "Z070000" "Z07:00:00"`

```go-html-template
{{ $t := "2023-01-27T23:44:58-08:00" }}
{{ $t = time.AsTime $t }}
{{ $t = $t.Format "Jan 02, 2006 3:04 PM Z07:00" }}

{{ $t }} â†’ Jan 27, 2023 11:44 PM -08:00 
```

Strings such as `PST` and `CET` are not time zones. They are time zone _abbreviations_.

Strings such as `-07:00` and `+01:00` are not time zones. They are time zone _offsets_.

A time zone is a geographic area with the same local time. For example, the time zone abbreviated by `PST` and `PDT` (depending on Daylight Savings Time) is `America/Los_Angeles`.
