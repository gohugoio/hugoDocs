When specifying the regular expression, use a raw [string literal] (backticks) instead of an interpreted string literal (double quotes) to simplify the syntax. With an interpreted string literal you must escape backslashes.

Go's regular expression package implements the [RE2 syntax]. The RE2 syntax is a subset of that accepted by [PCRE], roughly speaking, and with various [caveats]. Note that the RE2 `\C` escape sequence is not supported.
