`ref` and `relref` look up pages by their relative path (e.g.,Â `blog/post.md`) or their logical name (`post.md`) and return the permalink (`ref`) or relative permalink (`relref`) for the the page. Both functions require a `Page` object (usually satisfied with a "`.`"):

```
{{ relref . "about.md" }}
```

{{% note "Usage Note" %}}
`relref` looks up Hugo "Regular Pages" only. It can't be used for the homepage, section pages, etc.
{{% /note %}}

These functions are used in two of Hugo's built-in shortcodes. You can see basic usage examples of both `ref` and `relref` in the [shortcode documentation](/content-management/shortcodes/#ref-and-relref).

For an extensive explanation of how to leverage `ref` and `relref` for content management, see [Cross References](/content-management/cross-references/).
