By default, Hugo follows the capitalization rules published in the [Associated Press Stylebook]. Change your [site configuration] if you would prefer to:

- Follow the capitalization rules published in the [Chicago Manual of Style]
- Capitalize the first letter of every word
- Capitalize the first letter of the first word
- Disable the effects of the `title` function

The last option is useful if your theme uses the `title` function, and you would prefer to manually capitalize strings as needed.
