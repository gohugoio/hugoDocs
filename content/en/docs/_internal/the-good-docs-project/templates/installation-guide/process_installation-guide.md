This document describes the step-by-step process for researching, preparing and writing an installation guide. It is designed to be used by novice and experienced professionals to write a successful installation guide.

## Before writing an Installation guide

Before you begin a first draft of an installation guide, it is recommended to:

* Define the purpose of the installation guide.
* Identify the intended audience of the installation guide.
* Source knowledgeable individuals.
* Consider utilizing AI tools to search for existing installation guides and as a writing aid. Consult your company's guidelines before using AI tools.

## How to write an installation guide

The details of how to write an installation guide are contained in the [Installation Template Guide](https://gitlab.com/tgdp/templates/-/blob/main/installation-guide/guide_installation-guide.md).

## How to maintain an Installation guide

To maintain helpful, up-to-date and accurate information within an installation guide, the following is recommended:

* Establish version control of the installation guide.
* Use JIRA (or a similar tool) to implement and track changes. This helps reference back to previous versions.
* Schedule reviews of the installation guide shortly before every release. If that's not possible, set a schedule to review the installation guide.
* Maintain communication with the development team in order to ensure accurate information.
* Consider conducting user tests on the installation guide to discover documentation usability pain points. Adopt any user feedback you receive from these tests or from other sources.
* Test any new installation update.
* Ensure visual components are also updated, where necessary.
* Document the changes made.
* Review and finalize the updated installation guide.
