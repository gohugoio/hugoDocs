## Examples of Installation guide

The following list contains high quality examples that may provide significant value to readers:

* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/?utm_source=https://thegooddocsproject.dev) - Docker's one-click-install application lets developers build, share, and run containerized applications and microservices. Their installation guide makes "System Requirements" a subsection of the operating system types (installation types), which is helpful for users in cases where all the installation requirements and steps are different for each supported operating system type.
* [Nvidia Cuda Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/?utm_source=https://thegooddocsproject.dev) - Nvidia's parallel computing platform and programming model that enables dramatic increases in computing performance. Their installation guide includes a list of separate installation guides that discuss how to install the product for each installation type. In each installation guide, the required system requirements and how to verify the installation are clearly outlined.
* [Reactjs](https://react.dev/learn/installation/?utm_source=https://thegooddocsproject.dev) - React.js's JavaScript library for building web and native user interfaces. The installation guide is separated into sub-chapters to make navigation easy. It includes different ways of installing the library and interactive code sandboxes, allowing users to test what they want to install before installing it.
* [Apple Beta Software](https://developer.apple.com/support/install-beta/?utm_source=https://thegooddocsproject.dev) - Apple's beta versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS for developers to explore and experiment with.

| --------------- | ---------------          |
| [Survey Question Thread on X](https://twitter.com/iambolajiayo/status/1539627304015601664)| This public thread details best practices and common issues relating to installation guides written by industry experts with experience writing and leading documentation efforts in both corporate and open source environments. The suggestions were used as the foundation for the template research, which greatly influenced the "installation steps" of the template, the recommended best practices, and the structure of the guide. |
| [Docs for Developers: An Engineer's Field Guide to Technical Writing](https://docsfordevelopers.com/) | The "planning your documentation" chapter and writing how-to guides" section of the book helped define the flow of the template following the best practices recommended and the differences between system requirements and prerequisites. |
| [Diataxis Documentation System](https://diataxis.fr/?utm_source=https://thegooddocsproject.dev) | This documentation system explains the implications of tutorials, how-to guides, technical references, and explanations in a documentation. It helped us better understand the differentiation between a tutorial, how-to, and reference document, as described in the installation template guide. |
| [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/?utm_source=https://thegooddocsproject.dev) | This specification standard informed the "product version history" section of the template and the structure of the installation guide semantic versioning. |
