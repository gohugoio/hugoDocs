## Introduction

{Before using this template, please read the accompanying About the Style Guide
Template documentation.}

Welcome to our project! This style guide is intended for use by project
contributors, not necessarily end-users. It provides general guidance to anyone
who contributes to the project's documentation.

## Intended audience and scope

This style guide is intended for use by any contributors that are writing
documentation for {Your Project Name}, including software engineers. This guide
can help project contributors to communicate clearly and consistently in {you
define the scope: the project's end-user documentation, API documentation,
forum posts, and so forth.}

## Our preferred style guide

We have adopted the
{[your preferred style guide, such as the Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)}
for {Your Project} documentation. For a quick summary, see the
[Google style guide highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights).
The rest of this document describes our project-specific customizations to
{Google's or your preferred} guide.

Our project uses {your choice: standard American spelling or standard British
spelling, etc.} and our preferred dictionary is the
{[American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/) or your preferred
dictionary}.

When writing documentation for our project, align with the default guide's
voice and tone.
