Release notes provide a clear, structured overview of updates, fixes, and changes in a software release, helping users and stakeholders quickly understand what's new, improved, or fixed. This document serves as an essential touchpoint between development teams and users, making it easier to identify enhancements, spot new feature requirements, and track bug resolutions. Release notes are especially valuable for product updates that may impact user workflows, require configuration changes, or introduce new functionality. Use this template to ensure your release notes are clear, comprehensive, and actionable for a wide range of users.

Release notes are essential whenever you deliver updates that impact users, regardless of your release cadence. In Agile Software Development, frequent release notes keep users informed about continuous improvements and help teams stay aligned on incremental updates. For products with a regular release cadence-whether monthly, quarterly, or annually-release notes provide transparency into major changes and enhancements users can expect at predictable intervals. Release notes are also crucial for hotfixes or security patches, where immediate communication helps users understand critical fixes and any actions they might need to take.

## How to research release notes

Researching release notes is key to providing accurate and relevant information about product updates, requiring close collaboration with product managers, development teams, and customer support to ensure comprehensive coverage of new features and changes.

### Collaborate with Product Managers

Product managers are a key role for all software teams. The overall goal of product management is to ensure that software products deliver value to customers and that your products are competitive in the marketplace. Product managers are responsible for determining what goes into a release based on customer or user demand. As such, they usually have the best sense of what is going into each release and what the high priority items are, especially from a customer point of view.

#### Engage with product managers regularly

* Collaborate with product managers to stay updated on the product roadmap, release plans, and upcoming changes. This ensures you are well-informed about future features and developments.

* Participate in product brainstorming or ideation sessions to understand the strategic direction of the product.

#### Join product updates and demonstration sessions

* Attend sprint reviews or product demonstrations led by the product management team to observe new functionalities, modifications, or product iterations.

* Use these sessions to ask questions and clarify feature details, ensuring a solid understanding of how the new product functionalities solve user problems or provide value.

#### Leverage product manager expertise for deeper insights

* Work closely with product managers to get in-depth knowledge about the rationale behind key features or changes. This enables you to effectively communicate the benefits and impact to users.

* Gather detailed insights on which aspects of the product might require more user training or enablement support, based on user experience data and feedback gathered by product managers.

#### Identify key focus areas for communication

* Collaborate with product managers to understand user feedback, beta test results, and any other data points they track to prioritize communication efforts. This helps you highlight the most impactful features or updates in your training or enablement materials.

#### Create a feedback loop

* Establish a two-way feedback system with product managers, where insights from your enablement efforts or user interactions can be relayed back to help shape future product enhancements. This ensures that product development remains aligned with user needs and training outcomes.

### Engage with development teams

Development teams are essential partners in the release notes process, as they are directly responsible for building, testing, and troubleshooting the product. Their in-depth knowledge of new features, technical improvements, bug fixes, and known issues makes them invaluable sources of detailed information for release notes. Developers often have a clearer understanding of the technical aspects of updates, including any dependencies or configurations that users may need to know. Engaging with development teams ensures that release notes are both accurate and comprehensive, providing users with critical insights into the products latest changes and improvements.

#### Maintain regular communication

* Hold regular meetings with development teams to stay updated on releases, bug fixes, and feature changes.

* Join sprint planning sessions for early insights and to prepare release notes in advance.

#### Attend sprint reviews and demos

* Participate in reviews or demos to see new features in action and clarify technical details.

* Capture known issues or limitations to address them in release notes.
  
#### Leverage developer insights

* Understand the rationale behind changes to explain both the "what" and "why" in release notes.

* Prioritize complex features for detailed explanations and create a feedback loop to improve future releases.

#### Track progress and adjust for changes

* Monitor bug fixes and enhancements, and stay informed of any last-minute changes to update release notes promptly.

### Collaborate with customer support teams

Customer support teams play a crucial role in the release notes process by acting as the primary bridge between the product and its users. They have deep insights into common pain points, frequently reported issues, and areas where users may need additional guidance. Support teams can provide valuable context about the types of updates or fixes that will have the most impact from a user perspective, helping to highlight key details that users care about. Collaborating with customer support ensures release notes are user-focused and address the real-world concerns that matter most to your audience.

#### Regular syncs for customer insights

* Meet with support teams to gather feedback on key customer issues, ensuring the most impactful fixes are highlighted in the release notes.

* Coordinate with support or customer service teams to identify common pain points or frequently asked questions. This insight can guide you on what should be highlighted in the release notes, especially regarding bug fixes or improvements.

### Review product roadmaps

Check the product backlog or roadmap regularly for future developments that require documentation in future release notes. Understanding the long-term goals helps provide context for the current release.

### Interview key stakeholders

Conduct interviews or surveys with key stakeholders, such as product managers, engineers, customer support managers, and even users, to gain insights into the impact of changes and ensure that the release notes capture the full value of the update.

### Test new features

If possible, use a sandbox or pre-release environment to engage with the new features or updates firsthand. This will allow you to understand how the changes function in practice, making your descriptions more accurate and useful.

## How to write release notes

Writing effective release notes involves prioritizing clarity and user-focused language, organizing content by importance, and maintaining a consistent format to ensure users can quickly understand the value of new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### Prioritize clarity and conciseness

Use simple, direct language to explain changes. Avoid jargon and technical terms unless necessary, and provide explanations if you must use them. Focus on what the user needs to know to understand the update.

### Organize content by importance

Start with the most impactful changes, such as new features or critical fixes, then move on to minor improvements or tweaks. This structure helps users quickly identify what's important to them.

### Use a consistent format

Maintain a consistent format across all release notes. Common sections include:

* **Version number** and **release date**

* **New features**: Description of new functionalities and their benefits.

* **New features requiring configuration updates**: Inform users about new features or enhancements that need additional configuration or changes in settings to function correctly.

* **Improvements/Enhancements**: Details on performance improvements, UI/UX changes, etc.

* **Bug fixes**: Use consistent phrasing, like "Resolved an issue..." for each entry, and briefly explain how each fix benefits the user experience.

* **Known issues**: Any unresolved problems that may impact the user.

### Focus on the value to users

Describe changes in terms of how they benefit the user. Rather than simply stating a feature has been added, explain how it improves their workflow, saves time, or adds functionality.

### Make it scannable

Use bullet points, headers, and short paragraphs to make the release notes easy to scan. Users often want to quickly identify what's relevant to them, so avoid lengthy blocks of text.

### Use visuals when needed

If the changes are complex or visual (UI updates, for example), include screenshots or GIFs to illustrate the changes. This is especially helpful for features that require visual guidance to understand.

### Include links to more information

If a new feature or update requires a more detailed explanation or documentation, link to help articles, user manuals, or video tutorials.

## How to maintain release notes

Maintaining release notes requires a structured approach to ensure they remain accessible, consistent, and up-to-date. By creating a centralized repository, monitoring feedback, and establishing a regular review process, teams can ensure that release notes continue to serve as accurate, valuable resources over time.

### Create a centralized repository

Maintain an easily accessible, centralized location where all past release notes are archived. This allows users and internal teams to easily reference previous versions if needed.

### Keep consistency across multiple channels

Ensure that release notes are consistent across all platforms--whether the product's website, customer portal, or internal knowledge base. This prevents users from encountering outdated or conflicting information.

### Monitor feedback and questions

Regularly gather feedback from users and support teams on the clarity and usefulness of your release notes. If certain sections cause confusion or lead to frequent support requests, iterate and adjust your format or content to address these concerns.

### Establish a review process

Set up a regular review cycle with stakeholders, such as product managers, developers, and support to ensure that the release notes accurately reflect the updates and align with future product goals.

### Document lessons learned

After each release, document what went well in writing and maintaining the release notes and what can be improved. Use this information to refine the process for future releases.

### Track and version control

Use version control to manage changes in your release notes over time. This helps in maintaining a history of edits and ensures that you can roll back or review previous versions if needed.
