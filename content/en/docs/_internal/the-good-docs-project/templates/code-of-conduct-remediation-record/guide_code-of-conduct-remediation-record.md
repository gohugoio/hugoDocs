This is the guide that explains how to use the Good Docs Project Code of Conduct remediation record, which is part of the Code of Conduct template set.

The Code of Conduct template set includes:

* **Code of Conduct** - Use to create and explain your community's Code of Conduct.
* **Code of Conduct response plan** - Use to create and explain the policy your team will follow as you handle Code of Conduct incidents.
* **Code of Conduct incident record** - A form that is filled out when a community moderator takes an incident report from a community member.
* **Code of Conduct remediation record** - A form that is filled out when a community moderator meets with a community member to explain the consequences of a Code of Conduct violation.

You might also consider using the `../our-team/template_our-team.md` template to let your community members know who they can contact to report a Code of Conduct violation. This document is useful beyond Code of Conduct violations. It is a core document that helps you clearly communicate who belongs to your open source project or organization.

## Why do I need a Code of Conduct remediation record?

See the `guide_code-of-conduct.md` for reasons to incorporate a Code of Conduct and response plan.

The Code of Conduct remediation record is part of the documentation that needs to be kept when investigating and resolving Code of Conduct incidents.
It is important to file this documentation to enable the community moderators to identify and prevent potential repeated patterns of abuse in the community.
