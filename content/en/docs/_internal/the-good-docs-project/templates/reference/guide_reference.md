Reference articles provide information-oriented descriptions of specific components or characteristics of your product.
The purpose of a reference article is to concisely present information as a structured set of entries, with little to no procedural or instructional content.

A reference article works well when it:

* is consistent in structure, terminology, and tone.
* contains concise, descriptive information that is relevant to its overview
* avoids high-level usage-instructions or description for the product as a whole

## Content of your reference article

### The Overview section

Summarize what this reference article is about.

* Explain what all the entries defined on the page have in common.

### The Body section

The structure of reference articles varies based on what kind of information you are documenting. Formats that permit structured presentation of entries are best: tables, lists, interactive object-schemas, etc.
In most cases, reference information is easiest to express as a table.

Use the "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) method and re-use content if it's written for the same audience, and it fits within your reference document without modification.

### Code-generated documentation

Reference documentation can often be auto-generated from source code and/or comments within the code. It is typically easier to keep auto-generated docs current, accurate and complete, as the documentation is maintained next to the code it describes.
Ensure code-generated documentation is thoroughly written.
This is important for API reference docs and package descriptions documented in code doc-blocks or produced with tools such as the Open API tool chain.
