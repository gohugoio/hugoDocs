This document explains best practices for researching, writing, and maintaining a terminology system.

## Researching a terminology system

To create a terminology system, the following tasks are typically perfomed.

* Gathering of terms that you want to define
* Redefinition of terms in case terms needs tuning for a particular use case
* Disambiguation of terms
* Rejection of terms that you do not want people to use
* Gathering of alternative terms, including acronyms and abbreviations
* Collection of for translation and localization aids
* Establishment of the part of speech that term can be used
* Collection of updates that the term has had, if that is important for your case
Terms might be spread out in different documents and might be conflicting. It might take some time to get people to agree on a term, plan for that time.

## Writing a terminology system

Identify who the stakeholeders are: who needs to agree upon the terms and who needs buy-in and alignment about the terms? Who signs off on them and gives final approval?
If your project has many working groups, make sure that terms and the definitions are discussed and agreed across all stakeholders. For example, an image might be referred to as 'visual aid' in the public website, yet, because of legacy reasons, an image is referred to as a .jpg file in the storage group.
Terms might be spread out in different documents and might be conflicting. It might take some time to get people to agree on a term, plan for that time.

## Maintaining a terminology system

A terminology system will evolve over time. New terms are created, some terms get obsolete, products change names, just as it happens with the language we speak.
To maintain a terminology system currently, plan for periodical reviews and timely updates. When new terms are introduced, updated, or archived, make sure to announce the changes internally and externally.
