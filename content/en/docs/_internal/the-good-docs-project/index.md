## About us

[The Good Docs Project](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/) (TGDP) is a global community of technical writers, doc tools experts, software engineers, and UX designers who are committed to improving the quality of documentation in open source software and beyond. We aim to educate and empower people to create high-quality documentation by providing them with templates, best practices, and tools to enhance their documentation in open source and beyond.

Our [template repository](https://gitlab.com/tgdp/templates/-/tree/main) supports your documentation process by offering a variety of template packs tailored to meet the diverse needs of the open source community. Each template pack is curated to ensure you have every document type necessary for thorough and engaging documentation, helping your projects to thrive and grow.

### Core Pack Templates

The core documentation pack is our flagship template pack and it includes the core, fundamental content types that every documentation project needs. If you download one template pack for your project, it should be this one.

[Concept](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template/concept)
: An explanation of a concept, context, or background information about a product or its features.

[How-to](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template/how-to)
: A how-to is a concise set of numbered steps to do one task with the product.

[README](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template/readme)
: REAMDE files include information users need to know about your project, including how users can engage with the project and get started with the tool.

[Reference](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template/reference)
: A reference document provides specific, in-depth details about a particular topic.

[Release notes](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template/release-notes)
: Release notes communicate new features, improvements, bug fixes, and known issues about a product to users and stakeholders.

[Troubleshooting](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template/troubleshooting)
: A list of common problems (referred to as symptoms) experienced by users, an explanation of the causes, and steps to resolve the issue.

[Tutorial](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template/tutorial)
: Instructions for setting up an example project using the product, intended for the purpose of hands-on learning.

### Additional templates

These are a few of their non-core templates that might be useful:

[Quickstart](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template/quickstart)
: A quickstart introduces your users to your application for the first time. It focuses on the primary feature of the application and helps your users to start using the application as quickly as possible.

[Glossary](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template/glossary)
: A glossary is a common reference document that organizes terms and their definitions. It is best practice for glossaries to only store terms that are specific to a particular industry, organization, or team. Terms or descriptions defined in an established dictionary typically shouldn't be included in a glossary.
