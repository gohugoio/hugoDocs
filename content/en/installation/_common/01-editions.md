## Editions

Hugo is available in two editions: standard and extended. With the extended edition you can:

- Encode to the WebP format when [processing images]. You can decode WebP images with either edition.
- [Transpile Sass to CSS] using the embedded LibSass transpiler. The extended edition is not required to use the [Dart Sass] transpiler.

We recommend that you install the extended edition.
