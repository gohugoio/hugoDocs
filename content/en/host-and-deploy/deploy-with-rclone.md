Use these instructions to deploy your site to a web server with [Rclone][].

## Deployment constraints

{{% include "/_common/deployment-constraints.md" %}}

Rclone meets both requirements, making it a reliable tool for synchronizing your local build with a web server.

## Prerequisites

Please complete the following tasks before continuing:

1. Create a Hugo project and test it with the `hugo server` command.
1. Set the [`baseURL`][] in your project configuration to the URL of your production site.
1. Configure [SSH key authentication][] to log in to your web server, and load your key into `ssh-agent`.
1. Grant your SSH user write access to the document root, the directory from which your web server serves files.
1. Install [`rclone`][] on your local machine. You do not need to install `rclone` on your web server.
1. Use a POSIX shell such as Bash or Zsh on Linux or macOS. On Windows, use [Windows Subsystem for Linux][] (WSL).

## Procedure

Step 1
: Create a `deploy.sh` file in the root of your project, adjusting the configuration values as needed.

  ```sh {file="deploy.sh" copy=true}
  #!/usr/bin/env sh

  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # @file
  # Builds a Hugo project and deploys it to a web server with Rclone.
  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Exit on error or undefined variables
  set -eu

  # Configuration
  SSH_USER="jsmith"
  SSH_HOST="example.org"
  SSH_PORT="22"
  SRC="public/"
  DEST="/var/www/html/"

  # Build
  hugo build \
    --cleanDestinationDir \
    --gc \
    --minify

  # Deploy
  rclone sync \
    --checksum \
    --config "" \
    --no-update-dir-modtime \
    --stats 0 \
    --verbose \
    "${SRC}" ":sftp,host=${SSH_HOST},port=${SSH_PORT},user=${SSH_USER},known_hosts_file=~/.ssh/known_hosts:${DEST}"
  ```

  Set `SRC` to your `publishDir`. Set `DEST` to the path of the document root on your web server. A path that does not begin with a slash is relative to your home directory, which is common with shared hosting.

Step 2
: Make the script executable.

  ```sh
  chmod +x deploy.sh
  ```

Step 3
: Run the script to build and deploy your site.

  ```sh
  ./deploy.sh
  ```

  To preview changes without modifying anything on your web server, add the `--dry-run` flag to the `rclone sync` command.

## Command-line flags

The `hugo build` command uses these flags:

`--cleanDestinationDir`
: Removes orphaned files from the `publishDir`.

`--gc`
: Removes unused files from the [file cache][].

`--minify`
: [Minifies][] the output.

The `rclone sync` command deletes files on your web server that do not exist in the local `publishDir`, and uses these flags:

`--checksum`
: Compares files by checksum instead of by modification time and size. To compare checksums, Rclone runs commands such as `md5sum` on your web server. If your SSH user cannot run shell commands, Rclone compares files by size only.

`--config ""`
: Ignores the Rclone configuration file. The script defines the connection with an inline [connection string][] instead.

`--no-update-dir-modtime`
: Skips setting directory modification times on your web server.

`--stats 0`
: Disables periodic transfer statistics.

`--verbose`
: Lists each file that is transferred or deleted.
