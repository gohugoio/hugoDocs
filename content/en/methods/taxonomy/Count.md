The `Count` method on a `Taxonomy` object returns the number of number of [weighted pages](g) to which the given [term](g) has been assigned.

{{% include "/_common/methods/taxonomy/get-a-taxonomy-object.md" %}}

## Count the weighted pages

Now that we have captured the "genres" `Taxonomy` object, let's count the number of weighted pages to which the "suspense" term has been assigned:

```go-html-template
{{ $taxonomyObject.Count "suspense" }} â†’ 3
```
