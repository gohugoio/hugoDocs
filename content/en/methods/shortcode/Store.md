{{< new-in 0.139.0 />}}

Use the `Store` method to create a [scratch pad](g) to store and manipulate data, scoped to the current shortcode. To create a scratch pad with a different [scope](g), refer to the [scope](#scope) section below.

{{% note %}}
With the introduction of the [`newScratch`] function, and the ability to [assign values to template variables] after initialization, the `Store` method within a shortcode is mostly obsolete.
