{{% deprecated-in 0.139.0 %}}
Use the [`SHORTCODE.Store`] method instead.

This is a soft deprecation. This method will be removed in a future release, but the removal date has not been established. Although Hugo will not emit a warning if you continue to use this method, you should begin using `SHORTCODE.Store` as soon as possible.

Beginning with v0.139.0 the `SHORTCODE.Scratch` method is aliased to `SHORTCODE.Store`.

{{% /deprecated-in %}}

The `Scratch` method within a shortcode creates a [scratch pad] to store and manipulate data. The scratch pad is scoped to the shortcode.

{{% note %}}
With the introduction of the [`newScratch`] function, and the ability to [assign values to template variables] after initialization, the `Scratch` method within a shortcode is obsolete.
