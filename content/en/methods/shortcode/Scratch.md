{{% deprecated-in 0.139.0 %}}
Use the [`SHORTCODE.Store`] method instead.

This is a soft deprecation. This method will be removed in a future release, but the removal date has not been established. Although Hugo will not emit a warning if you continue to use this method, you should begin using `SHORTCODE.Store` as soon as possible.

Beginning with v0.139.0 the `SHORTCODE.Scratch` method is aliased to `SHORTCODE.Store`.
