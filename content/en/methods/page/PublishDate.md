By default, Hugo excludes pages with future publish dates when building your site. To include future pages, use the `--buildFuture` command line flag.

Set the publish date in front matter:

{{< code-toggle file=content/news/article-1.md fm=true >}}
title = 'Article 1'
publishDate = 2023-10-19T00:40:04-07:00
{{< /code-toggle >}}

The publish date is a [time.Time] value. Format and localize the value with the [`time.Format`] function, or use it with any of the [time methods].

```go-html-template
{{ .PublishDate | time.Format ":date_medium" }} â†’ Oct 19, 2023
```

In the example above we explicitly set the publish date in front matter. With Hugo's default configuration, the `PublishDate` method returns the front matter value. This behavior is configurable, allowing you to set fallback values if the publish date is not defined in front matter. See&nbsp;[details].
