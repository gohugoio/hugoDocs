By default, Hugo does not publish draft pages when you build your site. To include draft pages when you build your site, use the `--buildDrafts` command line flag.

{{< code-toggle file=content/posts/post-1.md fm=true >}}
title = 'Post 1'
draft = true
{{< /code-toggle >}}

```go-html-template
{{ .Draft }} â†’ true
```
