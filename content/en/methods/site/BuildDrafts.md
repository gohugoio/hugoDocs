By default, draft pages are not published when building a site. You can change this behavior with a command line flag:

```sh
hugo --buildDrafts
```

Or by setting `buildDrafts` to `true` in your site configuration:

{{< code-toggle file=hugo >}}
buildDrafts = true
{{< /code-toggle >}}

Use the `BuildDrafts` method on a `Site` object to determine the current configuration:

```go-html-template
{{ .Site.BuildDrafts }} â†’ true
```
