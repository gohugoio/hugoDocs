There is almost never a good reason to use this method in your templates. Its usage tends to be fragile due to misconfiguration.

Use the [`absURL`], [`absLangURL`], [`relURL`], or [`relLangURL`] functions instead.

[`absURL`]: /functions/urls/absURL
[`absLangURL`]: /functions/urls/absLangURL
[`relURL`]: /functions/urls/relURL
[`relLangURL`]: /functions/urls/relLangURL
