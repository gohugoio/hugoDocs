The `gist` shortcode was deprecated in version 0.143.0 and will be removed in a future release. To continue embedding GitHub Gists in your content, you'll need to create a custom shortcode:

1. Create a new file: Create a file named `gist.html` within the `layouts/shortcodes` directory.
1. Copy the source code: Paste the [original source code]({{% eturl gist %}}) of the gist shortcode into the newly created `gist.html` file.

This will allow you to maintain the functionality of embedding GitHub Gists in your content after the deprecation of the original shortcode.

```

Include this in your Markdown:

```text
{{</* gist user 23932424365401ffa5e9d9810102a477 */>}}

To display a specific file within the gist:

```text
