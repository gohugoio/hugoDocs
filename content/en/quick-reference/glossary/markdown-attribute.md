A _Markdown attribute_ is a key-value pair attached to a Markdown element.  These attributes are commonly used to add HTML attributes, like `class` and `id`, to the element when it's rendered into HTML.  They provide a way to extend the basic Markdown syntax and add more semantic meaning or styling hooks to your content.
