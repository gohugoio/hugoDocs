title: version
---

A _version_ is a [_dimension_](g) that represents a specific iteration, release, or lifecycle stage of content. While [_language_](g) focuses on localization and [_role_](g) focuses on audience, the version dimension allows you to maintain multiple states of the same content simultaneously. Common use cases include software release cycles such as v1.0.0 or v2.6.7.
