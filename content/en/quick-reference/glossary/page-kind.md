title: page kind
---

A classification of pages, one of `home`, `page`, `section`, `taxonomy`, or `term`. See&nbsp;[details](/methods/page/kind/).

Note that there are also `RSS`, `sitemap`, `robotsTXT`, and `404` page kinds, but these are only available during the rendering of each of these respective page's kind and therefore *not* available in any of the `Pages` collections.
