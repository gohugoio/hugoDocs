A _resource type_ is the main type of a resource's [media type](/methods/resource/mediatype/). Content files such as Markdown, HTML, AsciiDoc, Pandoc, reStructuredText, and Emacs Org Mode have resource type `page`. Other resource types include `image`, `text`, `video`, and others. Retrieve the resource type using the [`ResourceType`](/methods/resource/resourcetype/) method on a `Resource` object.
