title: unified file system
---

Hugo's _unified file system_ provides a layered view for each of its seven [_component_](g) types: [_archetypes_](g), assets, content, data, templates, [_translation tables_](g), and static files. Project component directories are layered over [_module_](g) component directories. Hugo searches these layers in order to locate files.
