A _branch bundle_ is a top-level content directory or any content directory containing an&nbsp;`_index.md`&nbsp;file. Analogous to a physical branch, a branch bundle may have descendants including [_leaf bundles_](g) and other branch bundles. A branch bundle may also contain [_page resources_](g) such as images.
