A _resource_ is any file consumed by the build process to augment or generate content, structure, behavior, or presentation. For example: images, videos, content snippets, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and data.

Hugo supports three types of resources: [_global resources_](g), [_page resources_](g), and [_remote resources_](g).
