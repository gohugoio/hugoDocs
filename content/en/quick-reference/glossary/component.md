A _component_ is a collection of related files, housed within the [_unified file system_](g), that fulfills a specific function in building a Hugo website. These components are categorized into seven types: [_archetypes_](g), assets, content, data, templates, [_translation tables_](g), and static files, and can be defined within the project or provided by [_modules_](g).

  Each component has a dedicated directory within the unified file system:
