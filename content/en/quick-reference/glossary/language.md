title: language

A _language_ is a [_dimension_](g) that facilitates the localization and internationalization of content. It allows a logical page to be represented in different locales while maintaining the same structure and metadata. In Hugo, the language dimension enables features like string translation, localized URLs, and language-specific formatting for dates and numbers.
