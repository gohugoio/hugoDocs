title: content type
---

A _content type_ is a classification of content inferred from the top-level directory name or the `type` set in [front matter](g). Pages in the root of the `content` directory, including the home page, are of type "page". The content type is a contributing factor in the template lookup order and determines which [archetype](/content-management/archetypes/) template to use when creating new content.
