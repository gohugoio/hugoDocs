When we had to build the website for [Linfa](https://linfa.io), our very first consumer product, [Sinapsi](http://www.sinapsi.com) suggested us to go for Hugo. They showed us few of the available themes to choose from as a starting point to organize the site content. Then they teached us how easy was to write content by using markdown syntax and we were caught.

After a while we decide to deeply personalize the latest universal theme by [bootstrapious](https://bootstrapious.com/p/universal-business-e-commerce-template) and make it multilingual.

Hugo is going to be our way toward [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture. We are in the process of integrating [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) active components into Hugo for a next release of our website to make it more interactive by including [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) features as well. 

As soon as we'll have time to clean the theme we developed for Linfa website, we are going to publish it. Hopefully, it will be useful to others as well.
