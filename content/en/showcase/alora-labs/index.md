At Alora, we're always looking to build the best technology â€” whether it be for our customers, or for internal projects like our website. 

Our website was originally built using **Jekyll**, another static site generator. When we came across Hugo, we were very interested and immediately converted our website to use it instead. 

After using it, we were immediately hooked. It's **blazing fast**, flexible, and simple to use.

Because we love it so much, we now also help companies with Hugo development and implementation, whether it be migrating from another platform or setting up a new site.
