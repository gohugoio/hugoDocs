[Budibase](https://www.budibase.com) is similar to Hugo in many ways; we are focused on speed, flexibility and we're open source. Choosing Hugo was an easy option in the end as it presented us with numerous benefits including:

- **Speed** - We wanted fast build times - there was only one option - Hugo.
- **SEO** - Google crawls our site a lot faster than websites created with JS. We use a great Schema script which helps us structure our content for search engines. Also, Hugo's focus on content creation allows us to produce great content using shortcodes in markdown - which we love.
- **Simplicity** - Hugo is super easy to get up running. Also, the folder structure is easy to understand and with less dependencies the learning curve is lower than other SSGs.
- **Community/Documentation** - The documentation is extensive and easy to understand. If the documentation doesn't solve your issue the community will. The community is very active and helpful.

We host our Hugo website with Netlify. Combined, they are a match made in heaven.

Cheers to [@bep](https://github.com/bep) and [community](https://discourse.gohugo.io/) for prividing us with Hugo, and help when required.
