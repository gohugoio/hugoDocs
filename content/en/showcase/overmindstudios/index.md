After running our site on the Wordpress CMS for quite some years, the downsides of this became more and more apparent. Plugins weren't updated to work with newer Wordpress versions, customization was hard, the page was slow to load due to all the added bloat.\
So we decided to have a fresh start. The main reasons that attracted me to Hugo:
- Fast to build and iterate
- No PHP needed
- Customization (we needed a range of different pages and layouts, as well as video backgrounds)
- Simplicity/easy to learn
- Security (no backend or MySQL database that can be broken into)

Since webdesign/programming is not our core business, we are happy that updating the website with new projects is a breeze now. We have a great Lighthouse score, the loading times are great from almost everywhere on earth and we have more time being creative instead of trying to work around the quirks and not breaking the website with every update.
