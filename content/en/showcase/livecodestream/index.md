When I started **Live Code Stream** it was pretty clear to me that I wanted to have full control over the site, I wanted it to be high performant and cost-efficient.

It was a fast decision to go with a static generator, and thus the search for the perfect solution began. 

## Why Hugo?
Hugo covered all the main points I had to build my website, but additionally it offered a huge selection of themes (though I ended up building my own as my site grew in complexity).

I tried a few options, but **Hugo** was super easy to set up, blazing fast to build, and I got my first site deployed to AWS in a matter of minutes.

In addition when I wanted to get specific things working, the Hugo documentation was rock solid, with clear examples on how to do things, I rarely neeed to Google for an issue, but to rather just read the docs.

Here are some of the features I liked the most (note that they are not on a particular order)

- Documentation
- Markdown for content
- Multiple environments
- Template system
- Shortcodes (I built a few of my own)
- Speed
- Integration with AWS

**Hugo** gave us the control we needed, no plugins required.
