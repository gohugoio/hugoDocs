Swiss [Arolla campsite](http://www.camping-arolla.com/) runs the highest campsite in Europe and I'm completely re-doing their actuel Website with Hugo.

But they just launch a brand new offer (luxury tents with bed and fire oven), and we couldn't wait for the proper new website for having this promoted : we needed the website up and running within 24h !

So we decided to quickly launch a dedicated [independant web site](https://www.cocoon-arolla.com) using all the powefull tools included with [gohugo.io](http://gohugo.io) and some things we already knew & used :

- Choose a spectacular landing theme in the rich [Hugo Themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/) collection : [Airspace Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/airspace-hugo/) by Themefisher.
- Replace the main images.
- Add a [hugo-easy-gallery / photoswipe](https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery) on the main page with attractive images.
- Add the promo video with a simple *vimeo* shortcode.
- Replace the Google Maps widget by the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) equivalent
- Use a [Zotabox](http://www.zotabox.com) contact form.
- Write the content in French & in English directly on the content pages, describe their services, add fun facts and true testimonies.
- Setup a GPRD compliant site with the new Hugo options.
- Use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for publishing it in a breeze.

The first version was up in 4 hours, and the polished 2 languages version was published on Netlify the next day.

This would have been impossible to do it in such a short time without all the powerfull Hugo tools and Netlify simplicity.
