In the heart of the Swiss Alps, at an altitude of 1.950 meters *(highest campsite in Europe)* [Camping Arolla](http://www.camping-arolla.com/) is located in a beautiful position with a panorama of stunning mountains and glaciers.

It offers dozens of routes and walks of every variety starting just a stoneâ€™s throw away.

Our new *Cocooning & Cosy* tents are designed for two people, including a real king size bed, a wood stove, and everything you need to cook.

And you can enjoy the exclusive official [Yakari](http://www.lelombard.com/series-bd/yakari,35/) tent.
