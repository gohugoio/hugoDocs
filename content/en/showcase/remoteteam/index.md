We're all like moving fast at the company. Why I asked performance for a static site builder? Is it matter? The answer is **yes**. As a frontend developer, I was frustrated with the old ruby based static site builder. When I changed a single line of HTML code in the development mode, I was waiting for compiling around **1.4** minutes I mean which is crazy to me. OK, as far as you get the result as an HTML site, it's pretty much the same but from the frontend view, it's important. Otherwise, things drive you crazy. It seems just a small choice but the impact is huge. Also, we have very handy template functions now which we are using for improving the performance and page speed score. So why we moved **Hugo**?

- **Development.** Compile-time is pretty good with lots of pages along with SASS compiling, embedding CSS, and Javascript in real-time.
- **Flexibility.** Hugo supports different render engines, different file formats, and different content strategies at the same time. It gives you more power than any other.
- **Freedom.** I'm working very closely with the content team to building handy UI's and improve user experience, and I feel like I can give them more gadgets while building content.
- **CMS Friendly.** Now It's easy to integrate with the CMS tools as long as you build your content with Markdown and *Front Matter* variables. 

We are continuously changing design and content widgets, also trying to improve website speed scores all the time. And **Hugo** gives me the time to build these features.
