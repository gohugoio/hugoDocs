We're all like moving fast at the company. Why did I ask performance for a static site builder? Is it matter? The answer is **yes**. As a frontend developer, I was frustrated with the old ruby based static site builder. We embed CSS files in the HTML for performance purposes. When I changed a single line of SCSS code in the development mode, I was waiting for compiling the site around **1.4 minutes** I mean which is crazy to me. OK, as far as you get the result as HTML, it's pretty much OK, but from the developer performance, it's important for the business. Otherwise, things drive you crazy. It seems just a small choice but the impact of your process is huge. So why we moved **Hugo**?

- **Development.** Compile-time is pretty good with lots of pages along with SASS compiling, embedding CSS, and Javascript in real-time.
- **Flexibility.** Hugo supports different render engines, different file formats, and different content strategies at the same time. It gives you more power than any other.
- **Freedom.** I'm working very closely with the content team to building handy UI's, implementing rich snippets, improve user experience, and I feel like *Hugo* can give us more gadgets while building our content pages.
- **CMS Friendly.** Now It's easy to integrate with the CMS tools as long as you build your content with Markdown and *Front Matter* variables. 

We are continuously changing the design and content widgets, also trying to improve the website speed score all the time. And **Hugo** gives me the time to build these features.
