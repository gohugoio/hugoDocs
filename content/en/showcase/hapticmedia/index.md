Our goal was to create a simple, effective and multilingual blog on [3D technology](https://hapticmedia.fr/blog/en/3d-technology/) that could be managed by a non-technical profile.

## Why Hugo?
Hugo addresses all these needs, coupled with [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) for its administration via a "turnkey" interface. We have attached particular importance to SEO, and therefore to the creation of an advanced taxonomy system. Thus, each author and tag has a dedicated page, listing the related posts.


## What we liked
- The **multilingual** content support, especially simple to setup.
- The **multiple environments** support (develop, staging, test, production, ...).
- Although a hard start with the Go language, the power of the **Hugo's templating**.
- The **partial layouts**, including the `internals` (e.g. social metas).
- The **build time**, unbeatable ⚡️⚡️⚡️.


## Tools & workflow
- We used the same design as **[our website](https://hapticmedia.fr/en/)**, recreated as a Hugo HTML template.
- **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io)** for the static website generator.
- **[CircleCI](https://circleci.com)** for continuous integration & deployment.
- **[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)** for web hosting.
- **[Forestry.io](https://forestry.io)** for the content management.

**All of these tools allow our editor to manage the blog's content without having to worry about its technical aspect, which is managed by the developers.**
