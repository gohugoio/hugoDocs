A **content type** is a way to organize your content. Hugo resolves the content type from either the `type` in front matter or, if not set, the first directory in the file path. E.g. `content/blog/my-first-event.md` will be of type `blog` if no `type` is set.

A content type is used to

* Determine how the content is rendered. See [Template Lookup Order](/templates/lookup-order/) and [Content Views](https://gohugo.io/templates/views) for more.
* Determine which [archetype](/content-management/archetypes/) template to use for new content.
