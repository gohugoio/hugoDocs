You should define the available languages in a `languages` section in your site configuration.

> Also See [Hugo Multilingual Part 1: Content translation]

## Configure Languages

The following is an example of a site configuration for a multilingual Hugo project:

{{< code-toggle file="config" >}}
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
copyright = "Everything is mine"

[params]
[params.navigation]
help  = "Help"

[languages]
[languages.en]
title = "My blog"
weight = 1
[languages.en.params]
linkedin = "https://linkedin.com/whoever"

[languages.fr]
title = "Mon blogue"
weight = 2
[languages.fr.params]
linkedin = "https://linkedin.com/fr/whoever"
[languages.fr.params.navigation]
help  = "Aide"

[languages.ar]
title = "مدونتي"
weight = 2
languagedirection = "rtl"

[languages.pt-pt]
title = "O meu blog"
weight = 3
{{< /code-toggle >}}

Anything not defined in a `languages` block will fall back to the global value for that key (e.g., `copyright` for the English `en` language). This also works for `params`, as demonstrated with `help` above: You will get the value `Aide` in French and `Help` in all the languages without this parameter set.

With the configuration above, all content, sitemap, RSS feeds, pagination,
and taxonomy pages will be rendered below `/` in English (your default content language) and then below `/fr` in French.

When working with front matter `Params` in [single page templates], omit the `params` in the key for the translation.

`defaultContentLanguage` sets the project's default language. If not set, the default language will be `en`.

If the default language needs to be rendered below its own language code (`/en`) like the others, set `defaultContentLanguageInSubdir: true`.

Only the obvious non-global options can be overridden per language. Examples of global options are `baseURL`, `buildDrafts`, etc.

**Please note:** use lowercase language codes, even when using regional languages (ie. use pt-pt instead of pt-PT). Currently Hugo language internals lowercase language codes, which can cause conflicts with settings like `defaultContentLanguage` which are not lowercased. Please track the evolution of this issue in [Hugo repository issue tracker](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/7344)

### Disable a Language

You can disable one or more languages. This can be useful when working on a new translation.

{{< code-toggle file="config" >}}
disableLanguages = ["fr", "ja"]
{{< /code-toggle >}}

Note that you cannot disable the default content language.

We kept this as a standalone setting to make it easier to set via [OS environment]:

```bash
HUGO_DISABLELANGUAGES="fr ja" hugo
```

If you have already a list of disabled languages in `config.toml`, you can enable them in development like this:

```bash
HUGO_DISABLELANGUAGES=" " hugo server
```

### Configure Multilingual Multihost

From **Hugo 0.31** we support multiple languages in a multihost configuration. See [this issue](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4027) for details.

This means that you can now configure a `baseURL` per `language`:

> If a `baseURL` is set on the `language` level, then all languages must have one and they must all be different.

Example:

{{< code-toggle file="config" >}}
[languages]
[languages.fr]
baseURL = "https://example.fr"
languageName = "Français"
weight = 1
title = "En Français"

[languages.en]
baseURL = "https://example.com"
languageName = "English"
weight = 2
title = "In English"
{{</ code-toggle >}}

With the above, the two sites will be generated into `public` with their own root:

```text
public
├── en
└── fr
```

**All URLs (i.e `.Permalink` etc.) will be generated from that root. So the English home page above will have its `.Permalink` set to `https://example.com/`.**

When you run `hugo server` we will start multiple HTTP servers. You will typically see something like this in the console:

```text
Web Server is available at 127.0.0.1:1313 (bind address 127.0.0.1)
Web Server is available at 127.0.0.1:1314 (bind address 127.0.0.1)
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

Live reload and `--navigateToChanged` between the servers work as expected.


## Translate Your Content

There are two ways to manage your content translations. Both ensure each page is assigned a language and is linked to its counterpart translations.

### Translation by filename

Considering the following example:

1. `/content/about.en.md`
2. `/content/about.fr.md`

The first file is assigned the English language and is linked to the second.
The second file is assigned the French language and is linked to the first.

Their language is __assigned__ according to the language code added as a __suffix to the filename__.

By having the same **path and base filename**, the content pieces are __linked__ together as translated pages.

{{< note >}}
If a file has no language code, it will be assigned the default language.
{{</ note >}}

### Translation by content directory

This system uses different content directories for each of the languages. Each language's content directory is set using the `contentDir` param.

{{< code-toggle file="config" >}}
languages:
  en:
    weight: 10
    languageName: "English"
    contentDir: "content/english"
  fr:
    weight: 20
    languageName: "Français"
    contentDir: "content/french"
{{< /code-toggle >}}

The value of `contentDir` can be any valid path -- even absolute path references. The only restriction is that the content directories cannot overlap.

Considering the following example in conjunction with the configuration above:

1. `/content/english/about.md`
2. `/content/french/about.md`

The first file is assigned the English language and is linked to the second.
The second file is assigned the French language and is linked to the first.

Their language is __assigned__ according to the content directory they are __placed__ in.

By having the same **path and basename** (relative to their language content directory), the content pieces are __linked__ together as translated pages.

### Bypassing default linking

Any pages sharing the same `translationKey` set in front matter will be linked as translated pages regardless of basename or location.

Considering the following example:

1. `/content/about-us.en.md`
2. `/content/om.nn.md`
3. `/content/presentation/a-propos.fr.md`

{{< code-toggle >}}
translationKey: "about"
{{< /code-toggle >}}

By setting the `translationKey` front matter param to `about` in all three pages, they will be __linked__ as translated pages.

### Localizing permalinks

Because paths and filenames are used to handle linking, all translated pages will share the same URL (apart from the language subdirectory).

To localize the URLs, the [`slug`]({{< ref "/content-management/organization/index.md#slug" >}}) or [`url`]({{< ref "/content-management/organization/index.md#url" >}}) front matter param can be set in any of the non-default language file.

For example, a French translation (`content/about.fr.md`) can have its own localized slug.

{{< code-toggle >}}
Title: A Propos
slug: "a-propos"
{{< /code-toggle >}}

At render, Hugo will build both `/about/` and `/fr/a-propos/` while maintaining their translation linking.

### Page Bundles

To avoid the burden of having to duplicate files, each Page Bundle inherits the resources of its linked translated pages' bundles except for the content files (Markdown files, HTML files etc...).

Therefore, from within a template, the page will have access to the files from all linked pages' bundles.

If, across the linked bundles, two or more files share the same basename, only one will be included and chosen as follows:

* File from current language bundle, if present.
* First file found across bundles by order of language `Weight`.

{{% note %}}
Page Bundle resources follow the same language assignment logic as content files, both by filename (`image.jpg`, `image.fr.jpg`) and by directory (`english/about/header.jpg`, `french/about/header.jpg`).
{{%/ note %}}

## Reference the Translated Content

To create a list of links to translated content, use a template similar to the following:

{{< code file="layouts/partials/i18nlist.html" >}}
{{ if .IsTranslated }}
<h4>{{ i18n "translations" }}</h4>
<ul>
  {{ range .Translations }}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ .Lang }}: {{ .Title }}{{ if .IsPage }} ({{ i18n "wordCount" . }}){{ end }}</a>
  </li>
  {{ end }}
</ul>
{{ end }}
{{< /code >}}

The above can be put in a `partial` (i.e., inside `layouts/partials/`) and included in any template, whether a [single content page][contenttemplate] or the [homepage]. It will not print anything if there are no translations for a given page.

The above also uses the [`i18n` function][i18func] described in the next section.

### List All Available Languages

`.AllTranslations` on a `Page` can be used to list all translations, including the page itself. On the home page it can be used to build a language navigator:

{{< code file="layouts/partials/allLanguages.html" >}}
<ul>
{{ range $.Site.Home.AllTranslations }}
<li><a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ .Language.LanguageName }}</a></li>
{{ end }}
</ul>
{{< /code >}}

## Translation of Strings

Hugo uses [go-i18n] to support string translations. [See the project's source repository][go-i18n-source] to find tools that will help you manage your translation workflows.

Translations are collected from the `themes/<THEME>/i18n/` folder (built into the theme), as well as translations present in `i18n/` at the root of your project. In the `i18n`, the translations will be merged and take precedence over what is in the theme folder. Language files should be named according to [RFC 5646] with names such as `en-US.toml`, `fr.toml`, etc.

Artificial languages with private use subtags as defined in [RFC 5646 &#167; 2.2.7](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646#section-2.2.7) are also supported. You may omit the `art-x-` prefix for brevity. For example:

```text
art-x-hugolang
hugolang
```

Private use subtags must not exceed 8 alphanumeric characters.

### Query basic translation

From within your templates, use the `i18n` function like this:

```go-html-template
{{ i18n "home" }}
```

The function will search for the `"home"` id:

{{< code-toggle file="i18n/en-US" >}}
[home]
other = "Home"
{{< /code-toggle >}}

The result will be

```text
Home
```

### Query a flexible translation with variables

Often you will want to use the page variables in the translation strings. To do so, pass the `.` context when calling `i18n`:

```go-html-template
{{ i18n "wordCount" . }}
```

The function will pass the `.` context to the `"wordCount"` id:

{{< code-toggle file="i18n/en-US" >}}
[wordCount]
other = "This article has {{ .WordCount }} words."
{{< /code-toggle >}}

Assume `.WordCount` in the context has value is 101. The result will be:

```text
This article has 101 words.
```

### Query a singular/plural translation

In other to meet singular/plural requirement, you must pass a dictionary (map) with a numeric `.Count` property to the `i18n` function. The below example uses `.ReadingTime` variable which has a built-in `.Count` property.

```go-html-template
{{ i18n "readingTime" .ReadingTime }}
```

The function will read `.Count` from `.ReadingTime` and evaluate whether the number is singular (`one`) or plural (`other`). After that, it will pass to `readingTime` id in `i18n/en-US.toml` file:

{{< code-toggle file="i18n/en-US" >}}
[readingTime]
one = "One minute to read"
other = "{{.Count}} minutes to read"
{{< /code-toggle >}}

Assuming `.ReadingTime.Count` in the context has value is 525600. The result will be:

```text
525600 minutes to read
```

If `.ReadingTime.Count` in the context has value is 1. The result is:

```text
One minute to read
```

In case you need to pass a custom data: (`(dict "Count" numeric_value_only)` is minimum requirement)

```go-html-template
{{ i18n "readingTime" (dict "Count" 25 "FirstArgument" true "SecondArgument" false "Etc" "so on, so far") }}
```

## Localization

The following localization examples assume your site's primary language is English, with translations to French and German.

{{< code-toggle file="config" >}}
defaultContentLanguage = 'en'

[languages]
[languages.en]
contentDir = 'content/en'
languageName = 'English'
weight = 1
[languages.fr]
contentDir = 'content/fr'
languageName = 'Français'
weight = 2
[languages.de]
contentDir = 'content/de'
languageName = 'Deutsch'
weight = 3

{{< /code-toggle >}}

### Dates

With this front matter:

{{< code-toggle >}}
date = 2021-11-03T12:34:56+01:00
{{< /code-toggle >}}

And this template code:

```go-html-template
{{ .Date | time.Format ":date_full" }}
```

The rendered page displays:

Language|Value
:--|:--
English|Wednesday, November 3, 2021
Français|mercredi 3 novembre 2021
Deutsch|Mittwoch, 3. November 2021

See [time.Format] for details.

### Currency

With this template code:

```go-html-template
{{ 512.5032 | lang.FormatCurrency 2 "USD" }}
```

The rendered page displays:

Language|Value
:--|:--
English|$512.50
Français|512,50 $US
Deutsch|512,50 $

See [lang.FormatCurrency] and [lang.FormatAccounting] for details.

### Numbers

With this template code:

```go-html-template
{{ 512.5032 | lang.FormatNumber 2 }}
```

The rendered page displays:

Language|Value
:--|:--
English|512.50
Français|512,50
Deutsch|512,50

See [lang.FormatNumber] and [lang.FormatNumberCustom] for details.

### Percentages

With this template code:

```go-html-template
{{ 512.5032 | lang.FormatPercent 2 }} ---> 512.50%
```

The rendered page displays:

Language|Value
:--|:--
English|512.50%
Français|512,50 %
Deutsch|512,50 %

See [lang.FormatPercent] for details.

## Menus

You can define your menus for each language independently. Creating multilingual menus works just like [creating regular menus][menus], except they're defined in language-specific blocks in the configuration file:

{{< code-toggle file="config" >}}
defaultContentLanguage = "en"

[languages.en]
weight = 0
languageName = "English"

[[languages.en.menu.main]]
url    = "/"
name   = "Home"
weight = 0

[languages.de]
weight = 10
languageName = "Deutsch"

[[languages.de.menu.main]]
url    = "/"
name   = "Startseite"
weight = 0
{{< /code-toggle >}}

The rendering of the main navigation works as usual. `.Site.Menus` will just contain the menu in the current language. Note that `absLangURL` below will link to the correct locale of your website. Without it, menu entries in all languages would link to the English version, since it's the default content language that resides in the root directory.

```go-html-template
<ul>
    {{- $currentPage := . -}}
    {{ range .Site.Menus.main -}}
    <li class="{{ if $currentPage.IsMenuCurrent "main" . }}active{{ end }}">
        <a href="{{ .URL | absLangURL }}">{{ .Name }}</a>
    </li>
    {{- end }}
</ul>
```

### Dynamically localizing menus with i18n

While customizing menus per language is useful, your config file can become hard to maintain if you have a lot of languages

If your menus are the same in all languages (ie. if the only thing that changes is the translated name) you can use the `.Identifier` as a translation key for the menu name:

{{< code-toggle file="config" >}}
[[menu.main]]
name = "About me"
url = "about"
weight = 1
identifier = "about"
{{< /code-toggle >}}

You now need to specify the translations for the menu keys in the i18n files:

{{< code file="i18n/pt.toml" >}}
[about]
other="Sobre mim"
{{< /code >}}

And do the appropriate changes in the menu code to use the `i18n` tag with the `.Identifier` as a key. You will also note that here we are using a `default` to fall back to `.Name`, in case the `.Identifier` key is also not present in the language specified in the `defaultContentLanguage` configuration.

{{< code file="layouts/partials/menu.html" >}}
<ul>
    {{- $currentPage := . -}}
    {{ range .Site.Menus.main -}}
    <li class="{{ if $currentPage.IsMenuCurrent "main" . }}active{{ end }}">
        <a href="{{ .URL | absLangURL }}">{{ i18n .Identifier | default .Name}}</a>
    </li>
    {{- end }}
</ul>
{{< /code >}}

## Missing Translations

If a string does not have a translation for the current language, Hugo will use the value from the default language. If no default value is set, an empty string will be shown.

While translating a Hugo website, it can be handy to have a visual indicator of missing translations. The [`enableMissingTranslationPlaceholders` configuration option][config] will flag all untranslated strings with the placeholder `[i18n] identifier`, where `identifier` is the id of the missing translation.

{{% note %}}
Hugo will generate your website with these missing translation placeholders. It might not be suitable for production environments.
{{% /note %}}

For merging of content from other languages (i.e. missing content translations), see [lang.Merge].

To track down missing translation strings, run Hugo with the `--printI18nWarnings` flag:

```bash
hugo --printI18nWarnings | grep i18n
i18n|MISSING_TRANSLATION|en|wordCount
```

## Multilingual Themes support

To support Multilingual mode in your themes, some considerations must be taken for the URLs in the templates. If there is more than one language, URLs must meet the following criteria:

* Come from the built-in `.Permalink` or `.RelPermalink`
* Be constructed with the [`relLangURL` template function][rellangurl] or the [`absLangURL` template function][abslangurl] **OR** be prefixed with `{{ .LanguagePrefix }}`

If there is more than one language defined, the `LanguagePrefix` variable will equal `/en` (or whatever your `CurrentLanguage` is). If not enabled, it will be an empty string (and is therefore harmless for single-language Hugo websites).


## Generate multilingual content with `hugo new`

If you organize content with translations in the same directory:

```text
hugo new post/test.en.md
hugo new post/test.de.md
```

If you organize content with translations in different directories:

```text
hugo new content/en/post/test.md
hugo new content/de/post/test.md
```
