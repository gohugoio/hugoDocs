The `static` folder is where you place all your **static files**, e.g. stylesheets, JavaScript, images etc.

You can set the name of the static folder to use in your configuration file.  From **Hugo 0.31** you can configure as many static directories as you need. All the files in all the static directories will form a union filesystem.

Example:

{{< code-toggle copy="false" file="config" >}}
staticDir = ["static1", "static2"]
[languages]
[languages.no]
staticDir = ["staticDir_override", "static_no"]
baseURL = "https://example.no"
languageName = "Norsk"
weight = 1
title = "PÃ¥ norsk"

[languages.en]
staticDir2 = "static_en"
baseURL = "https://example.com"
languageName = "English"
weight = 2
title = "In English"
{{</ code-toggle >}}

In the above, with no theme used:

* The English site will get its static files as a union of "static1", "static2" and "static_en". On file duplicates, the right-most version will win.
* The Norwegian site will get its static files as a union of "staticDir_override" and "static_no".

**Note:** The `2` `static2` (can be a number between 0 and 10) is added to tell Hugo that you want to **add** this directory to the global set of static directories. Using `staticDir` on the language level would replace the global value.


**Note:** The example above is a [multihost setup](/content-management/multilingual/#configure-multilingual-multihost). In a regular setup, all the static directories will be available to all sites.
