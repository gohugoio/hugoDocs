They are stored in a reserved Front Matter object named `_build` with the following defaults:

{{< code-toggle >}}
_build:
  render: always
  list: always
  publishResources: true
{{< /code-toggle >}}

#### render

If `always`, the page will be treated as a published page, holding its dedicated output files (`index.html`, etc...) and permalink.

We extended this property from a boolean to an enum in Hugo 0.76.0. Valid values are:

never
: The page will not be included in any page collection.

always (default)
: The page will be rendered to disk and get a `RelPermalink` etc.

link
: The page will be not be rendered to disk, but will get a `RelPermalink`.

#### list

Note that we extended this property from a boolean to an enum in Hugo 0.68.0.

Valid values are:

never
: The page will not be included in any page collection.

always (default)
: The page will be included in all page collections, e.g. `site.RegularPages`, `$page.Pages`.

local
: The page will be included in any _local_ page collection, e.g. `$page.RegularPages`, `$page.Pages`. One use case for this would be to create fully navigable, but headless content sections.

If true, the page will be treated as part of the project's collections and, when appropriate, returned by Hugo's listing methods (`.Pages`, `.RegularPages` etc...).

#### publishResources

If set to true the [Bundle's Resources]({{< relref "content-management/page-bundles" >}}) will be published.
Setting this to false will still publish Resources on demand (when a resource's `.Permalink` or `.RelPermalink` is invoked from the templates) but will skip the others.

{{% note %}}
Any page, regardless of their build options, will always be available using the [`.GetPage`]({{< relref "functions/GetPage" >}}) methods.

### Illustrative use cases

#### Not publishing a page

Project needs a "Who We Are" content file for Front Matter and body to be used by the homepage but nowhere else.

```yaml
# content/who-we-are.md`
title: Who we are
_build:
 list: false
 render: false
```

```go-html-template
{{/* layouts/index.html */}}
<section id="who-we-are">
{{ with site.GetPage "who-we-are" }}
  {{ .Content }}
{{ end }}
</section>
```

#### Listing pages without publishing them

Website needs to showcase a few of the hundred "testimonials" available as content files without publishing any of them.

To avoid setting the build options on every testimonials, one can use [`cascade`]({{< relref "/content-management/front-matter#front-matter-cascade" >}}) on the testimonial section's content file.

{{< code-toggle >}}
title: Testimonials
_build:
  render: true
cascade:
  _build:
    render: false
    list: true # default
{{< /code-toggle >}}

```go-html-template
{{/* layouts/_defaults/testimonials.html */}}
<section id="testimonials">
{{ range first 5 .Pages }}
  <blockquote cite="{{ .Params.cite }}">
    {{ .Content }}
  </blockquote>
{{ end }}
</section>
