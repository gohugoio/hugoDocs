## Trouble: `hugo new` Aborts with EOF error

> I'm running into an issue where I cannot get archetypes working, when running `hugo new showcase/test.md`, for example, I see an `EOF` error thrown by Hugo.
>
> When I run Hugo with v0.12 via `hugo new -v showcase/test.md`, I see the following output:
>
> ```bash
> INFO: 2015/01/04 Using config file: /private/tmp/test/config.toml
> INFO: 2015/01/04 attempting to create  showcase/test.md of showcase
> INFO: 2015/01/04 curpath: /private/tmp/test/archetypes/showcase.md
> ERROR: 2015/01/04 EOF
> ```
>
> Is there something that I am blatantly missing?

## Solution: Carriage Returns

The solution is to add a final newline (i.e., `EOL`) to the end of your default.md archetype file of your theme. You can do this by adding a carriage return after the closing `+++` or `---` of your TOML or YAML front matter, respectively.

{{% note "Final EOL Unnecessary in v0.13+" %}}
As of v0.13, Hugo's parser has been enhanced to accommodate archetype files without final EOL thanks to the great work by [@tatsushid](https://github.com/tatsushid).
