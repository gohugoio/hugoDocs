Hugo relies heavily on the enthusiasm and participation of the open-source community. We need your support in both its development and documentation.

Hugo's contribution guidelines are [detailed in a `CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the Hugo source repository on GitHub.
