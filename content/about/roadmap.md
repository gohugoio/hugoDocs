To track Hugo's progress, see our [GitHub Milestones][milestones].

In no particular order, here are some other features currently being worked on:

* Even easier deployment to S3, SSH, GitHub, rsync. Give the [hosting and deployment][] section a shot.
* Import from other website systems. There are already [existing migration tools][migrate], but they donâ€™t cover all major platforms.
* An interactive web-based editor (See the [related forum thread][])
* Additional [themes][], which are always ongoing and [contributions are welcome][themescontrib]!
* Dynamic image resizing via shortcodes ({{< gh 1014 >}})
* Native support for additional content formats (AsciiDoc {{< gh 1435>}}, reST {{< gh 1436 >}})
* And, last but not least, [***your*** best ideas!][]

## Contributions Welcome

Feel free to [contribute to Hugo's development][devcontribute], [improve Hugo's documentation][doccontribute], or [open a new issue][newissue] if you have an idea for a new feature.
