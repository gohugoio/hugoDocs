# We use the front matter keywords field to determine related content. To
# ensure consistency, during site build we validate each keyword against the
# entries in data/keywords.yaml.

# As of March 5, 2025, this feature is experimental, pending usability
# assessment. We anticipate that the number of additions to data/keywords.yaml
# will decrease over time, though the initial implementation will require some
# effort.
